# Unicode Fonts

Unicode is full of a number of different characters that look very similar to normal latin characters but with funky diacritics and stylings. 
There are a number of websites and services that convert normal latin characters to these fonts. I wanted to make this more accessible to 
phone users in a simple and concise app. Simply copy the text you want to font-ify, click the appropriate button, and the clipboard will be converted 
to the new font! It's super fun to text with these fonts, and they (should) be functional everywhere.
